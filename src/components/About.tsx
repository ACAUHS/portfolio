                    My name is Joshua-Gabriel Camacho, and I am a Software Developer based in Toronto/Vancouver.
                    I mainly work in frontend development, and have an interest in learning the different technologies
                    available in the industry. I am also passionate about music: most notably hip-hop and jazz.
